      <h1>Simon Sinek&apos;s Golden Circle Framework</h1>
      <p>
        Unveiled in his influential 2009 TED Talk, &quot;How Great Leaders
        Inspire Action,&quot; and further detailed in his book, &quot;Start With
        Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action,&quot; Simon
        Sinek&apos;s Golden Circle is a revolutionary model of organizational
        behavior and leadership.
      </p>

      <h2>The Golden Circle: Why, How, What</h2>
      <p>
        The Golden Circle is composed of three concentric circles: Why, How, and
        What.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Why:</strong> This is the core belief of the business, the
          reason it exists beyond just making money. It&apos;s a purpose, cause,
          or belief that inspires everything the organization does.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How:</strong> This is how the business fulfills that core
          belief. It could be a unique approach or a differentiating value
          proposition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What:</strong> This is what the company does to fulfill that
          core belief, the products or services it provides.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Starting with Why</h2>
      <p>
        Sinek argues that while many companies start with &quot;what&quot; and
        then consider &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why,&quot; the most inspiring
        leaders and organizations work from the inside out, starting with
        &quot;why.&quot; This is because people don&apos;t buy what you do, they
        buy why you do it. When a company clearly communicates their
        &quot;why,&quot; it resonates with the belief system of the customers,
        creating loyalty and driving decision-making.
