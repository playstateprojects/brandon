      <h1>Simon Sinek's Golden Circle Framework</h1>
      <p>
        Unveiled in his influential 2009 TED Talk, "How Great Leaders Inspire
        Action," and further detailed in his book, "Start With Why: How Great
        Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action," Simon Sinek's Golden Circle is
        a revolutionary model of organizational behavior and leadership.
      </p>

      <h2>The Golden Circle: Why, How, What</h2>
      <p>
        The Golden Circle is composed of three concentric circles: Why, How, and
        What.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Why:</strong> This is the core belief of the business, the
          reason it exists beyond just making money. It's a purpose, cause, or
          belief that inspires everything the organization does.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How:</strong> This is how the business fulfills that core
          belief. It could be a unique approach or a differentiating value
          proposition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What:</strong> This is what the company does to fulfill that
          core belief, the products or services it provides.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Starting with Why</h2>
      <p>
        Sinek argues that while many companies start with "what" and then
        consider "how" and "why," the most inspiring leaders and organizations
        work from the inside out, starting with "why." This is because people
        don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it. When a company clearly
        communicates their "why," it resonates with the belief system of the
        customers, creating loyalty and driving decision-making.
